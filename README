This is Class::ErrorHandler, a base class for classes that need to do
error handling (which is, probably, most of them).

PREREQUISITES

None.

INSTALLATION

Class::ErrorHandler installation is straightforward. If your CPAN shell
is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Class::ErrorHandler'

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install
